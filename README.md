# Transfer Time Calculator

A simple React calculator that gives you the time it will take to download/upload a file (assuming ideal conditions) based off of the file's size + a defined transfer speed.

Alternatively, you can calculate the time it will take to upload a video based off of the video's length + the video's bitrate.
