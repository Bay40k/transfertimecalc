# Upload Time Calculator

A simple JavaScript calculator that gives you the time it will take to upload a file (assuming ideal conditions) based off of the file's size + a defined upload speed. 

Alternatively, you can calculate the time it will take to upload a video based off of the video's length + the video's bitrate.
